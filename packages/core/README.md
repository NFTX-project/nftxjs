# `@nftx/core`

This package contains various methods used internally by the nftx ecosystem and is not included in the main nftx.js package.

The core package can be used directly but it is strongly recommended that you use nftx.js and the NFTX API whenever possible. Direct use requires more setup, increased complexity, slower and more resource-intensive responses, and significantly higher subgraph and web3 hits.
